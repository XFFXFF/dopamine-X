# dopamine-X
[Dopamine](https://github.com/google/dopamine) is my favorite research framework of reinforcement learning, for
its very readable code and easy to try out new ideas. This 
project is mainly inspired by dopamine, and can also be said I am learning code from dopamine.  
  
My design princles are:  
- Flexible development: Make it easy to try out research ideas.  
- Concentration: Only focus on policy gradient or actor critic style algorithms.

Also inspired by:
- [openai/baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines)
